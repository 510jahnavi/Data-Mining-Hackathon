# Data-Mining-Hackathon

This project is a part of Data Mining Hackathon. Team ARJ developed an End to End Data Science Project from data extraction to dashboard creation.
Title of the Project is FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Analysis.

Given its strong performance across several key metrics (R-squared, test score, RMSE, MSE), **Ridge Regression** was chosen as the best choice among the evaluated models. It shows a good balance between complexity and performance, providing robust predictions without fitting too closely to the training data.
